frida (15.1.17~pirogue2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Add support for amd64:
     - control: add it to Architecture, alongside arm64 and armhf.
     - rules: add a mapping between amd64 and the x86_64-thin set of
       targets. The -thin part is required since otherwise Frida would try
       and perform some crossbuild, getting its wires crossed between x86
       and x86_64 anyway.
