It's usually to be using a debian/ prefix to distinguish Debian tags
from upstream tags. It's also possible to create several revisions
for the same upstream tag, which are encoded as ~pirogue1, ~pirogue2,
etc. in the changelog, but as _pirogue1, _pirogue2, etc. in git tags
(since ~ is a reserved character).

Therefore, drop the debian/ prefix as well as any ~pirogueN suffix
before parsing version information.
