frida (16.4.9~pirogue1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Set debian-branch = debian/bookworm in debian/gbp.conf (`gbp tag`).
  * Avoid leaking the path to the git checkout in various generated files
    (JS, static library, Python module) by disabling source maps:
     - disable-source-maps.diff
  * New upstream release.

frida (16.4.0~pirogue1) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * Strip auto/ prefix for debian/* tags.
  * Fix missing build-dep: python3-setuptools.
  * Remove extraneous build-dep: curl.
  * Fix missing --recursive option for `git submodule` operations.
  * Make sure to install frida-core-1.0.{deps,vapi} in
    /usr/share/vala/vapi/ as before: upstream build system modifications
    lead to their being installed under a directory matching the build
    directory (e.g. /home/kibi/deb-frida). Since modifying the build
    system doesn't seem easy, move them into place after installation.
  * Adjust frida-core-1.0.pc accordingly. It doesn't seem to be usable
    anyway because it references a number of libraries only available via
    the SDK/toolchain downloaded at the beginning of the build, but it
    makes sense to avoid adding new problems.
  * New upstream release.

frida (16.2.5~pirogue1) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Delete patch:
     - stop-looking-at-main.diff (no longer needed).
  * Refresh patch:
     - adjust-versioning-for-debian-tags.diff (context updated).
  * Adjust buildsystem:
     - Switch from none to makefile.
     - Delete the dh_auto_build override.
     - Add dh_auto_clean override, cleaning build/; letting `make clean`
       run would trigger issues otherwise.
     - Additionally clean the deps/ directory, where SDKs are downloaded.
     - Also run `git clean -xdf` in each submodule: __pycache__/
       directories appear in various places, but we also have some other
       things, like subprojects/frida-gum inside subprojects/frida-core.
  * Add patches:
     - fix-python-includes.diff to make sure both pyconfig.h and Python.h
       are found.
     - adjust-default-prefix.diff to use /usr instead of /usr/local.
  * Disable test suite for the time being.
  * Delete dh_python3 override, no longer needed.
  * Delete variables that are no longer needed.

frida (16.0.19~pirogue1) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Delete patch:
     - fix-missing-module.diff (no longer needed).
  * Refresh patch:
     - stop-looking-at-main.diff (context updated).
     - adjust-versioning-for-debian-tags.diff (context updated).
  * Add i386 support:
     - control: add i386 to Architecture.
     - rules: add i386 to x86-thin mapping.

frida (15.1.17~pirogue2) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Add support for amd64:
     - control: add it to Architecture, alongside arm64 and armhf.
     - rules: add a mapping between amd64 and the x86_64-thin set of
       targets. The -thin part is required since otherwise Frida would try
       and perform some crossbuild, getting its wires crossed between x86
       and x86_64 anyway. It only appears elsewhere in the build directory
       (in all cases) and needs to be stripped away.
